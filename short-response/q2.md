# Question

What are the steps to incorporating context into your application?

# Answer

First, create a Context object. Using the createContext() function.

Next you need to render the context provider. Using the returned context component. This can be used to wrap other components and be passed values.

Lastly, with useContext you can copy the Context object and its properties into the component that actually needs the data.



# Feedback

For the last one you do not want to copy the context object but rather get the values.
